# Spark AR Community Resources
## Purpose
[Facebook Developer Circle: Boston](https://www.facebook.com/groups/DevCBoston) has centered its programming around Spark AR and getting resources into the hands of developers and designers. We believe with an increase of available resources we will increase the accessibility of Spark AR to the worldwide community.

## How to use
All of the resources are kept within their own folder in this repository to help keep the main GitHub page cleaned up. Check the `Resources` folder for a list of all available projects. If you click into any of the folders within that folder you will find a README specific to that project that should give more information about what the project is.

## How to contribute
1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Create a new branch on your repository to put your resource in.
3. Create a new folder within the `Resources` folder that describes your project in a short way.
4. Create a folder called `demo` that contains either a gif or image of your project in action.
5. Create a `README.md` file that matches the template file.
6. Add all of your Spark AR assets to the main folder you created in step 3.
7. Commit all of your changes to your branch.
8. Open up a pull request from your forked repository and this repository and fill out the templated information.
9. Wait for someone to approve your pull request and merge it into `main`.
10. Pat yourself on the back for contributing to the community!
